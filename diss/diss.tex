\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of this project was to implement two models for music
generation and subsequently compare them: namely, a \emph{recurrent neural
network} (RNN) and \emph{multiple viewpoint system} (MVS). The two models were
to be compared using both a listening survey and some objective evaluation.

\section*{Work Completed}

All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Alex Coplan of St Catharine's College, being a candidate for Part II of the
Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work
described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be specified below, and
that the dissertation does not contain material that has already been used to
any substantial extent for a comparable purpose.
