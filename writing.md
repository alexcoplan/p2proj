# Dissertation Writing

- Start with conclusion/evaluation and work backwards. => all previous work supports conclusion.
- Put yourself in audience's position: what background knowledge can you assume? Cite the things you can't.
- Think about audience's assumptions: what will they be expecting to see in your work based on the title/abstract?
  - Even if these assumptions are incorrect, you will have to justify the absence of that content/approach.
  
N.B. draft need not be worded immaculately, since this version will see considerable revision in content. Supervisor may say you need to remove/reword entire sections!

## Things to avoid
 - Vagueness (obviously)
 - Hyperbole: don't over claim, you make it easy to find counter-examples.
 - All graphs, diagrams, and figures __must__ be referred to from the text: a dissertation isn't a blog post or powerpoint presentation!
 - Over-stating applicability
