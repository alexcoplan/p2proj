# Introduction:
 - statement of project goals / work accomplished, ~~~ abstract
 - motivation: from perspective of end user of the system
 - background: define musical terms, give examiner necessary musical background,
   reference literature to explain why these things are difficult; 
   - metrical structure
   - justify musical scope (Western Classical)
 - related work: techniques that have been used in this area
 - context of work: comparison between MVS and RNN, why is this interesting?
 - briefly outline structure of dissertation

# Preparation:
 - outline core deliverables
 - justify all choices:
  - describe possible alternative choices in technical detail
  - describe MVS and RNN in full detail: *diagrams*
  - choice of tools, libraries
  - choice of software engineering strategy

# Implementation
 - remember to mention interesting challenges as well as successes

# Evaluation:
 - compare with numbers from Pearce/Whorley

## ideas
 - pathalogical examples
 - cross entropy
 - human evaluation
 - subjective evaluation (annotated score + cross entropy/time)
