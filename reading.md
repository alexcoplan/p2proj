## Conklin, Witten: Multiple viewpoint systems for music prediction (1995)


## Pearce, Wiggins: Towards a Framework for the Evaluation of Machine Compositions (2001) ✅
- Core idea: to make our work more scientific, we need to present and provide evidence for _refutable claims_.
- E.g. "People cannot distinguish the machine composed music from human composed music"
- "Framework" for evaluation:
  - notion of a machine-learned "critic", which ensures style adherance
  - evaluate by _asking human subjects to distinguish compositions from data set vs generated ones_
  - => machine compositions evaluated objectively within a _closed_ system which does not consider aesthetic merit.
- Many subtleties discussed in Section 6 onwards; subjects exhibited bias towards classifying as machine generated

## Conklin: Music Generation from Statistical Models (2003) ✅
 - Overview of random walk versus Viterbi decoding vs sampling.
 - Random walk often fails to lead to overall high probabiltiy solutions.

## Whorley: Construction and Evaluation of Statistical Models of Melody and Harmony (PhD thesis, 2013)
 - Explores multiple viewpoint frameworks as statistical models of melody and harmony.
 - Multiple viewpoint framework was originated by Conklin and Cleary (1988)

## Whorley: Music Generation from Statical Models of Harmony (2016)

## Pearce: The construction and evaluation of statistical models of melodic structure in music perception and composition (PhD thesis, 2005)
 - Shows multiple viewpoint systems being used successfully
