Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.
                                                                 
I would like to implement, evaluate, and compare two different techniques for
music generation. Specifically, I would like to compare Markov techniques such
as Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models, or more general context models with
Recurrent Neural Networks. I intend to initially focus on melody generation, 
and later consider the generation of polyphonic music (for which melody 
generation is a prerequisite). 

I plan to evaluate the project primarily by performing a listening trial with
human subjects, asking the subjects to attempt to distinguish between
machine-composed compositions and human-composed samples from the corpus in a
blind trial.
                                                                 
                                                                 
                                                                 

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any computing resources
other than the Computing Service's MCS and software that is already installed
there, for example: your own machine, machines in College, special peripherals,
imported software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial extra
disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.
                                                                 
I shall use my own laptop and MIDI keyboard. I will be using open-source
software for music synthesis. No further special resources will be required.
