# Notes on auto-optimised MVSs and their performance

## params: intra_b = 0.25, inter_b = 0.5, lt_hist = 5, st_hist = 3

### Pitch 

optimized (w/o fib triple links):
{ pitch, duration->intref, posinbar->pitch, duration->seqint, posinbar->intref, 
  duration->pitch, rest->seqint, rest->intref }
 => 1.90477 bits

optimized (with fib triple links):
{ pitch, (fib x duration)->intref, duration->pitch, posinbar->seqint, rest->intref, (fib x duration)->pitch }
 => 1.89096 bits

sigkilled while evaluating:
{ pitch, (fib x duration)->intref, duration->pitch, posinbar->seqint, rest->intref, (fib x duration)->pitch, rest->pitch }
(leak now fixed). so further improvements possible


### Duration

optimized (with fib triple links):
{ duration, posinbar->duration, (fib x pitch)->duration, (fib x rest)->duration }
 => 0.855181

### Rest

optimized (with fib triple links):
{ rest, (fib x duration)->rest, (fib x pitch)->rest, duration->rest }
 => 0.142237

## parms: intra_b = 0.0, inter_b = 0.0, lt_hist = 5, st_hist = 3

### Rest

optimized (w/ fib triple links):
{ rest, (fib x duration)->rest, (fib x intref)->rest }
 => 0.109711

nb. this means that the choice of entropy bias affects the choice of viewpoints!
we can't just choose the entropy bias ad hoc up front and optimise it later...

TODO:
1. Add triple-linked fib VPs for pitch
2. Run all VP selections at different entropy biases (nominally (0.0, 0.25)^2)
and record results: write dissertation or work on survey while processing!
3. Generate new samples and continue
